# bosch_DM_code_presentation
A presentation for TEAM FIT by Demeter MÃ¡rton


In order to use my demo code, please clone the ultralytics yolov5 repo: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

Then add all the files in this repo to the main directory of yolov5 (including basketball_court.jpg).

To execute the demo, run the replaced detect.py file the following way from terminal (tested on ubuntu 18):

`python detect.py --source ./basket_test.mp4 --weights ./yolov5x.pt --view-img --save-txt`

If there is any question please write to: demeter.marton.cs@gmail.com
